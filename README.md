# PDF Merger App

A simple Python application to merge two or more PDF files from an **input** folder into a single PDF in an **output** folder. The application uses [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) for PDF handling and Python's built-in `logging` for logging activities.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SteffiPGalway/pdf_merger.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
